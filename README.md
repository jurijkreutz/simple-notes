# Simple Notes

This is an additional bonus project which I started working on during the `Advanced - Java Spring` module of the Codecool Full Stack Developer Coruse.

It is a project with a Java Spring Backend and a React Frontend. Users can log in, add new notes and manage old ones.

> ## Main technologies used
> - Spring Boot
> - Spring Web MVC, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security
> - React
> - H2 Database

## Current State

### Already done

- Simple React Frontend
- Spring Backend with endpoints for CRUD operations
- Spring Security with In-Memory-Users
- JWT handling for Spring Security
- Spring Data with H2 DB for saving notes (and soon, users)
- Tests covering the current backend

### To Do

- Remove In-Memory-Users (move to database)
- Add possibility for new Users to register
- Add different roles (ADMIN, USER)
- Add MaterialUI or another UI Library for React
- Dockerize
